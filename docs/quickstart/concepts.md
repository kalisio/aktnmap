# Basics

## <i class="las la-user"></i> User

A *person* who has been **registered** to Akt'n'Map. This can be done through two ways:
  * by creating his own **account** on the application,
  * by being *invited* within an organisation by another user of the application.

## <i class="las la-user-friends"></i> Organisation

A *shared workspace* between users where you can invite people to join and collaborate, notably to manage **events**.

A user can belong to *multiple* organisations and being assigned *different roles* in these organisations. A user can also create new organisations.

### <i class="las la-graduation-cap"></i> Role

A **role** assign you different *rights* inside an organisation or a group:
  * as a <i class="las la-user"></i> *member* you cannot update the organisation or the group (view right),
  * as a <i class="las la-briefcase"></i> *manager* you can also change the state of the organisation or the group (update right),
  * as a <i class="las la-certificate"></i> *owner* you can also delete the organisation or the group (full access).

::: tip
Rights are cumulative, a owner (respectively manager) owns all rights of a manager (respectively member).
:::

The manager of an organisation can:
  * manage **members** of this organisation,
  * create **groups** within this organisation and manage members of these groups.
The owner can as well detroy the organisation and manage payment means.

The manager of a group can manage **members** of this group. The owner can as well detroy the group.

::: tip
By creating an organisation or a group you become the owner by default but you can share this responsibility with others by assigning them new rights on this organisation or group.
:::

### <i class="las la-sitemap"></i> Group

A **group** allows to *delegate* the management of a shared workspace limited to its members. Users outside the group will not see it, neither its members.

### <i class="las la-tags"></i> Tag

A **tag** allows to *classify* a subset of your organisation members according to a *business criterium* (e.g. a skill or a service).

A tag is *transverse* to your organisation, meaning you can target with it people having the same criteria in different groups.

## <i class="las la-fire"></i> Event

An *information about a fact* to be shared between some members of an organisation. Typical events are interventions, crisis management actions, etc.

Events generate *notifications* on mobile devices of **participants** when created, updated and removed by its **coordinators**.

The participants and coordinators of an event can be selected as:
  * individual members,
  * groups,
  * tags.

::: tip
By creating an event you become the coordinator by default but you can share this responsibility with others by make them a coordinator as well.
:::

Akt'n'Map allows to attach to each event:
  * *pictures* or *documents* shared among participants,
  * a **[processes](../gofurther/processes.md)** defining interactions between participants and coordinators.

## Participant

A participant cannot modify an event although he can share documents and pictures.

## Coordinator

A coordinator can update and close (i.e. destroy) an event, and change its set of participants and coordinators.

His has also access to a *cartographic view* summarizing the position and state of each participant according to the process steps.
